# Extended Physics Breakdown – Project T.A.N.D.E.M.S.

RealSimHQ's T.A.N.D.E.M.S. physics are built using the bleeding-edge CSP features. Here's what sets them apart from vanilla AC and AC EVO.

---

<details>
  <summary><strong>• 5-Point Tyre Contact vs 1-Point</strong></summary>
  <p><em>What it is:</em> CSP 0.20+ replaces the single-patch tyre model with five independent contact points.</p>
  <p><em>Why it matters:</em> You get realistic transitions over curbs, grass, and bumps—no more “pop” and instant loss of grip.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>• Dynamic Chassis Flex & Torsion</strong></summary>
  <p><em>What it is:</em> Real-time body/frame torsion under load.</p>
  <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Feel the car twist and settle like in real life, instead of a rigid block.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>• Precision FFB Tweaks</strong></summary>
  <p><em>What it is:</em> A suite of new force-feedback parameters (damping, smoothing, channel emissives, etc.).</p>
  <p><em>Why it matters:</em> You actually feel weight transfer, tyre scrub, and suspension movement—not just engine torque.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>• Cosmic Suspension Physics Engine</strong></summary>
  <p><em>What it is:</em> Build your suspension from “atomic” joints—ball joints, sliders, distance joints—with separate spring/damper LUTs.</p>
  <p><em>Why it matters:</em> True-to-life camber change, roll center shifts, anti-dive/squat—all in real time.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>• 4 Extra Tyre Sets with Realistic Warming & Wear</strong></summary>
  <p><em>What it is:</em> Temperature-based grip curves and progressive degradation.</p>
  <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Predictable lap-to-lap evolution, just like on track.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>• Custom Collision Models</strong></summary>
  <p><em>What it is:</em> Server-side hooks for ERP, CFM, bounce, friction, intensity—even mass multipliers.</p>
  <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Crash behaviour you can dial in—soft-bounce or ACC-style contacts.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>• Exclusive to CSP – AC EVO Can’t Have ‘Em</strong></summary>
  <p><em>What it is:</em> Assetto Corsa Evo is a standalone rebuild and doesn’t support CSP or Content Manager mods.</p>
  <p><em>Why it matters:</em> These extended-physics goodies are only available via the paid CSP preview.</p>
</details>

## EVO vs CSP: What You’re Missing Without CSP Extended

| Feature | CSP Extended | AC EVO |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| 5-Point Tyre Contacts | ✅ | ❌ |
| Cosmic Suspension | ✅ | ❌ |
| Dynamic Chassis Flex | ✅ | ⚠️ Tuned rigid body |
| Live Physics Swaps | ✅ | ❌ |
| Advanced Wear & ERP | ✅ | ❌ |

## Verdict

- **AC EVO** is a *solid* step above vanilla AC—smooth transitions, better default FFB, more stable tyre response.
- **CSP + Extended Physics** is the *gold standard* if you want tunable realism: multi-point tyres, atomic suspensions, dynamic body flex, and in-session physics changes.

> 🏁 T.A.N.D.E.M.S. was built on CSP Extended to push realism as far as AC can go—because sideways deserves science too.
